##Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

From the given diagram, we can observe that there is a one-to-many relationship between the "Product_Category" and "Product" entities. Each record in the "Product_Category" table can be associated with multiple records in the "Product" table as the "category_id" column in the "Product" table references the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table. 
This relationship is further established by the presence of the "deleted_at" timestamp column in both tables, which indicates soft deletion and continued relationship tracking.

##How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, we can enforce a NOT NULL constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. 
This would require a valid category to be assigned when inserting a new product into the table. Additionally, implementing a foreign key constraint between the "category_id" column in the "Product" table and the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table can further strengthen data integrity.
This constraint would prevent insertion of a product with a non-existent category_id, thereby ensuring that only valid category IDs are assigned to the products.
